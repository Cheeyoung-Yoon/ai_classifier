# Stage 3: Classification and Clustering

## Purpose
Stage 3 handles the final classification and clustering operations.

## Key Characteristics
- **Embedding-Based**: Uses vector embeddings for similarity analysis
- **Multi-Algorithm**: KNN, CSLS, MCL clustering approaches
- **Result Processing**: Final output formatting and validation

## Planned Components

### Embedding Processing
- Vector generation from preprocessed text
- Similarity calculations
- Dimension reduction if needed

### Classification Algorithms
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Cross-domain Similarity Local Scaling (CSLS)
- Markov Clustering (MCL)

### Result Processing
- Classification result aggregation
- Confidence scoring
- Output formatting

## Current Files to Consider (when ready)
Based on current structure:
- `embed.py` related functionality
- Clustering algorithms
- Result collection and processing

## Dependencies
- **Input**: Preprocessed data from Stage 2
- **Output**: Final classification results and clusters
- **External**: Embedding models, clustering libraries

## Notes for Future Development
- Consider batch processing for large datasets
- Implement ensemble methods for improved accuracy
- Add result validation and quality metrics
- Design for different clustering granularity levels
